 Animal Image Classification DL Project
########################################

This project involves designing and training two deep learning models for animal image classification using the "Animals-10" dataset.

The models include:

- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- A Transfer Learning model using VGG16.

************************
*** Getting Started: ***
************************

Upload the Metadata File:
- Ensure that the animals10-metadata.json file is uploaded at the start of both programs in Google Colab or any other environment you are using.

Set Up Google Colab:
- Open the respective notebook in Google Colab.
- Choose a GPU runtime by navigating to Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator > GPU.

Run the Notebooks:
- Execute the code cells within each notebook in order to obtain the desired result.
- Training the models without a GPU can take hours, so ensure that the GPU is enabled.
